                <p style="font-size: 150%;">Rooms may be occupied on the day before the beginning of classes and through to the last day of the semester.
                    Rooms are allocated on a semester basis.  All fees are payable in advance at the Bursary Division.  Students who withdraw from the hostel for any reason, or who are expelled or are requested or withdrawn from College for any reason whatsoever, after the beginning of the semester are not entitled to return to the hall or to any refund of accommodation fees or any other regular charges.
                    It is an offence punishable by expulsion or suspension from the hall for any student to accommodate any visitor or student in his/her room overnight without the written permission of the Hostel Supervisor.
                    Students will be held responsible for any careless or willful destruction or damage of College property.  Repair costs of proven-damages/destruction will be charged to the students.  Any damage to common facilities shall be the collective responsibility of the students concerned.
                    At the close of the semester, expulsion from the hostel, or upon the severance of their connection with any part of the work of College, students are required to return immediately all keys and other property in their possession to the appropriate officer.
                    Wilful failure to submit keys at the close of semester is a punishable offence.
                    The Hall Adviser/Mistress must be notified of students meetings or any functions taking place in the hostels.  Applications for approval for holding functions in the hostels must be obtained from the applicants within 48 hours of that function.  Visitors attending such meetings or functions must sign the visitor’s books.
                    In the interest of hostel residents, noise must be kept to the minimum.  Wireless sets, radio, stereos sets are to be used not later than 10.00pm each day.  These instruments should not, however, be played in such a manner as to cause disturbance to others.  No appliance may, on any account, be connected to the lighting circuit.  Students must not tamper with or alter in any way, electrical installations in their rooms or any part of the hostel.
                    The installation and/or use of cookers, toasters, immersion, heaters, refrigerators, cooking rings, etc are not allowed in students’ rooms.
